<h3><span id="1_Measurement_and_Cutting_of_Rafters" class="ez-toc-section"></span>1. Measurement and Cutting of Rafters:</h3>
<ul>
<li>First of all, measurement of the building has to be done. The width and height of the&nbsp;<a href="https://9to5civil.com/secant-walls/">walls</a>&nbsp;should be measured so that the upper roof area will be made according to that. Tools are used in calculating the&nbsp;<a href="https://9to5civil.com/types-of-retaining-wall/">walls</a>&nbsp;like measuring tape, and if it&rsquo;s a small area, then you will also make it by analyzing the average area required to be covered.</li>
<li>The length of the common rafter should be measured, and roof pitch has to be measured to make the short ends of the roof.</li>
<li>Then the location of cuts will be marked on the rafter, which has to be cut.</li>
<li>After locating cut marks, the birdsmouth location also marked birdsmouth is a gap craved in the rafter so that it can be fixed on the top of the&nbsp;<a href="https://9to5civil.com/cmu-wall/">wall</a>&nbsp;of the building.</li>
<li>Now using a round saw, considerable length has to be cut, and also birdsmouth is also cut down.</li>
</ul>

<h3><span id="2_Assembling_of_the_King_and_Hip_Rafters" class="ez-toc-section"></span>2. Assembling of the King and Hip Rafters:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Six to seven rafters are attached in equal gaps to the centre, which helps to uplift the beam.</li>
<li>These rafters are nailed to the ridge beam, making it more solid and safe.</li>
<li>Six king common rafters are attached to the ridge board&rsquo;s end.</li>
<li>The hip rafters are fixed to the ridge beam by using nails, and also corners are fixed by nails to the walls.</li>
<li>The rest common rafters are adequately nailed to the ridge beam.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span id="3_Finishing_of_the_Hip_and_Valley_Roof" class="ez-toc-section"></span>3. Finishing of the Hip and Valley Roof</h3>
<ul>
<li>The jack rafters are nailed to the hip rafters to secure them to the walls of the building.</li>
<li>Plywood sheets are to be determined because they will be used in the making of the roof, so it is necessary to arrange the required number of sheets of plywood.</li>
<li>Then plywood sheets are nailed to the rafters.</li>
<li>Asphalt shingles are attached to the roof, and another material has to be attached to the roof.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the whole process of&nbsp;<a href="https://9to5civil.com/building-construction-process-step/">building</a>&nbsp;<strong>hip and valley roofs</strong>&nbsp;in detail.</p>
<h2><span id="How_Are_Hip_and_Valley_Rafters_Attached" class="ez-toc-section"></span>How Are Hip and Valley Rafters Attached?</h2>
<ul>
<li>The first step in the attachment of&nbsp;<strong>hip and valley rafters</strong>&nbsp;is hip roof is erected to get the ridge beam and four to six common rafters are positioned at an equal distance to give the centre position and then by using nail gun nail the rafters firmly to the two longest walls of the building and then the ridge beam is lifted to the required height.</li>
<li>The next step is attaching six to eight common rafters to the roof and nailing them to the walls so that they will work as strong support to the roof. Using the nail gun you have to nail these rafters to the beam from the top of common rafters.</li>
<li>There are more rafters that have to be attached from the sides of the walls these common rafters give tight hold to the roof. The ridge board is attached to the rafters by using nails and the structure will be ready.</li>
<li>It is necessary to give a hold to the corners too so that rafters are nailed from the ends of the corner to give extra support to the roof.</li>
<li>The rest work which is left or the thing which is left to attach is done by using nails, this is the last step of the process in which the structure is nailed properly so that no area will be left weak.</li>
